# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING üìöüìö

Welcome to the **NLP Basics** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for beginners and enthusiasts to explore the foundational concepts and techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It contains interactive Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate various NLP workflows, algorithms, and applications.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

**Key Goals of NLP**:
- Language Understanding: 
The ability to comprehend the meaning behind words, sentences, and context.
Examples: Sentiment analysis, text classification, entity recognition.

- Language Generation:
The ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant human-like text.
Examples: Text summarization, chatbots, machine translation.

**Why is NLP Important?**


NLP enables machines to bridge the gap between human communication and computers, making technology more accessible and human-friendly. It powers many modern applications that improve efficiency, automate tasks, and enhance user experiences in various domains like healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment.

## üìö Contents of the Repository

### 1. **NLP Preprocessing**
   - **Files**: `NLP_Preprocessing_1.ipynb`, `NLP_Preprocessing_2.ipynb`
   - **Description**: These files cover essential text preprocessing steps required for NLP pipelines.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Stop Word Removal
     - Tokenization
     - Stemming and Lemmatization
     - Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging
   - **Use Case**: Prepare raw text data for downstream NLP tasks.

### **How to Add Examples**
You can further customize the steps with examples in Markdown. For instance:

1. **Input Text:** *"I love programming in Python!"*
2. **After Text Cleaning:** *"i love programming in python"*
3. **Tokens:** *["i", "love", "programming", "in", "python"]*
4. **Stopwords Removed:** *["love", "programming", "python"]*
5. **Stemming/Lemmatization:** *["lov", "program", "python"]* or *["love", "program", "python"]*

Let me know if you'd like me to guide you through using Python libraries (like Matplotlib or Graphviz) or creating diagrams in specific tools!

### 2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - **File**: `NamedEntityRecognition.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how to extract and visualize named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) using the `spaCy` library.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Extraction of entities with labels such as PERSON, ORG, DATE, etc.
     - Visualization of entities using `displacy`.
   - **Use Case**: Identify key entities from unstructured text data.

   - **Description**: Analyzes word frequencies in text data using `spaCy`.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Tokenization and filtering of stop words and punctuation.
     - Identification of the top 10 most frequent words.
   - **Use Case**: Understand the most commonly used terms in a text dataset.

---

### 4. **Bigram Generation**
   - **File**: `convert_in_Biagram.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Generates bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) from a list of sentences.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Efficient implementation using Python's list comprehensions.
     - Example with sentences about flowers and their significance.
   - **Use Case**: Analyze word pair relationships for text modeling tasks.

---

### 5. **CYK Algorithm**
   - **File**: `CYK.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm for parsing sentences using context-free grammars.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Parsing of sentences using predefined grammars.
     - Step-by-step demonstration of the CYK algorithm.
