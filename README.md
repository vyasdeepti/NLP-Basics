# NLP Preprocessing Notebook

A repository dedicated to exploring foundational concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project includes implementations of key algorithms and techniques to help learners and practitioners gain a solid understanding of NLP fundamentals.
This Jupyter Notebook showcases various foundational techniques for natural language preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. It is designed as a practical guide for exploring common text preprocessing tasks that are essential for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

## Features

1. Stop Words Removal
Demonstrates how to remove stop words (e.g., 'and', 'the') from text using NLTK's stopwords module.
Customizes the stop words list to include additional punctuation marks.
2. Stemming
Implements stemming using the PorterStemmer to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "playing" -> "play").
Applies stemming to sentences, showcasing its impact on reducing word variations.
3. Lemmatization
Uses the WordNetLemmatizer for lemmatization, which reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "rocks" -> "rock").
Handles pluralization and irregular forms effectively (e.g., "wolves" -> "wolf").
4. Tokenization
Applies both word and sentence tokenization using NLTK's word_tokenize and sent_tokenize methods.
Splits text into manageable tokens for further processing.
5. Parts-of-Speech Tagging
Tags tokens with their respective parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb) using NLTK's pos_tag function.
Demonstrates tagging in sentences and its role in syntactic analysis.

- **CYK Algorithm Implementation**: The repository includes a Python implementation of the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm, which is used for syntactic parsing of sentences using context-free grammars. The provided implementation demonstrates:
  - Non-terminal and terminal symbol definitions.
  - Grammar rules for parsing.
  - A step-by-step parsing process to determine if a sentence conforms to the defined grammar.
  - Example usage with a sample sentence: "a very heavy orange book".

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The primary format for interactive code demonstrations and analysis.
- **Python**: Employed for implementing NLP algorithms, leveraging its simplicity and robust library ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vyasdeepti/NLP-Basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLP-Basics
   ```
3. Explore the `CYK` script to understand the CYK algorithm.

## Usage

Usage
This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to preprocessing tasks in NLP. It can be used as a starting point for projects requiring clean and structured text data.

- Run the CYK script to test the parsing algorithm with custom sentences.
- Modify the grammar rules or terminal symbols to adapt the algorithm to new contexts.
