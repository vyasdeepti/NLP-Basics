# NLP Basics

A repository dedicated to exploring foundational concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project includes implementations of key algorithms and techniques to help learners and practitioners gain a solid understanding of NLP fundamentals.

## Features

- **CYK Algorithm Implementation**: The repository includes a Python implementation of the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm, which is used for syntactic parsing of sentences using context-free grammars. The provided implementation demonstrates:
  - Non-terminal and terminal symbol definitions.
  - Grammar rules for parsing.
  - A step-by-step parsing process to determine if a sentence conforms to the defined grammar.
  - Example usage with a sample sentence: "a very heavy orange book".

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The primary format for interactive code demonstrations and analysis.
- **Python**: Employed for implementing NLP algorithms, leveraging its simplicity and robust library ecosystem.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vyasdeepti/NLP-Basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLP-Basics
   ```
3. Explore the `CYK` script to understand the CYK algorithm.

## Usage

- Run the CYK script to test the parsing algorithm with custom sentences.
- Modify the grammar rules or terminal symbols to adapt the algorithm to new contexts.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests to enhance its capabilities.
